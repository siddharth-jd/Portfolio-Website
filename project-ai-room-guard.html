            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project implements an AI “room guard” that can listen for a wake word, recognize who 
                is in front of the camera, and then respond using a conversational LLM. The system works as 
                an intelligent security assistant that can distinguish trusted users from unknown people and 
                react accordingly.

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Developed a multi-modal guard agent in Python by integrating voice activation 
                    using <b>SpeechRecognition</b>, high-accuracy face recognition with <b>DeepFace</b>, 
                    and a conversational LLM via the <b>Groq API</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Engineered a robust face verification module by fine-tuning the <b>VGG-Face</b> model and
                    using a custom cosine similarity threshold to clearly separate trusted users from unknown faces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implemented an autonomous monitoring loop that listens for a voice trigger, 
                    captures webcam frames, and decides whether to issue a verbal warning or a 
                    friendly greeting.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The system stays idle until a wake word is detected through the microphone.</li>
                <li>On activation, the webcam captures a face image and passes it through the VGG-Face model.</li>
                <li>The embedding is compared against stored trusted embeddings using cosine similarity.</li>
                <li>If the user is unknown, the system triggers a security warning; if trusted, it greets 
                    the user and can answer questions via the LLM.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
